# Python Code Repository 🐍

Welcome to my central Python repository! This archive documents my entire journey with the **Python** programming language, ranging from fundamental concepts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, and Machine Learning implementations.

## 📂 Repository Organization

This repository is categorized into specific domains to keep the codebase organized. Below is a breakdown of the directories:

### 🧠 Core Concepts & Learning
* **`BeginningWithPython/`**: My initial steps into Python programming.
* **`w3School/`**: Practice exercises and examples from w3Schools.
* **`OOP/`**: Implementation of Object-Oriented Programming concepts (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism).
* **`Random_exercise/`**: Miscellaneous scripts and logic-building exercises.

### 🧩 Algorithms & Problem Solving
* **`Data_Structure_&_Algorithom/`**: Implementations of core data structures (Lists, Trees, Graphs) and algorithms.
* **`Problem Solving(HackerRank)/`**: My solutions to various challenges on **HackerRank**.
* **`Problem_Solving(Leetcode)/`**: Optimized solutions for **LeetCode** problems.

### 🤖 Data Science & Machine Learning
* **`Tensorflow/`**: Deep Learning models and experiments using the TensorFlow framework.
* **`Kaggle_Course/`**: Exercises and notebooks from Kaggle's Data Science curriculum.

### 💼 Academic & Professional Work
* **`Internship/`**: Projects and tasks completed during my internship periods.
* **`Varsity_Task/`**: Academic coursework, specifically assignments for courses like **CSE-405**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) - *Used extensively for ML and DSA.*
* **Libraries**:
    * **Data Science**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
    * **ML/DL**: `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`
    * **Utilities**: `os`, `sys`, `math`

## 🚀 How to Navigate

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Nirob-0812/Python_Code.git](https://github.com/Nirob-0812/Python_Code.git)
    ```

2.  **Explore a specific section:**
    * If you are looking for **DSA**, check the `Data_Structure_&_Algorithom` folder.
    * If you want to see **Machine Learning** code, check `Tensorflow` or `Kaggle_Course`.

3.  **Run a Script:**
    Most files are standalone scripts or notebooks.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    
    ```

## ⚠️ Purpose

This repository serves as a **Personal Knowledge Base** and **Portfolio**.
* It reflects my growth from a beginner to an advanced Python developer.
* It is useful for reviewing syntax, algorithms, and past project logic.
